            Urban Interns is an online marketplace that connects high-growth companies with talented candidates looking for internships, part-time jobs, freelance work and contract positions. 
            <br /><br />
We offer all of the ease and efficiency of a full-service job board, with just one catch; if you're looking for full-time employment, you'll best be served elsewhere.
<br /><br />
Why? Because the way we work and staff is no longer focused on full-time. <br />
<ul class="greenli">
<li>Small businesses are growing quickly, but full-time help is often more (or more expensive) than what they need.</li> 
<li>Talented people are looking for flexible, part-time work to gain experience, increase their earnings, or both.</li> 
<li>Technology makes it easy to accomplish many tasks from anywhere, anytime.</li>
</ul>
UrbanInterns was created to meet the needs of the new job market. The world of work is no longer just "another day at the office."
